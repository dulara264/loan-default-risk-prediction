# Loan Default Risk Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will default on a loan using
machine learning techniques.  
The objective is to help financial institutions assess credit risk and make
data-driven lending decisions.

The project follows a complete and structured machine learning workflow including:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Model comparison and selection

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Domain: Credit Risk / Finance
- Number of records: ~32,000
- Number of features: 11
- Target variable: `loan_status`
  - `0` → Non-default
  - `1` → Default

The dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical features related to
customer demographics, income, loan details, and credit history.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

Key observations:
- The target variable is **imbalanced**, with fewer loan default cases.
- Missing values are present in employment length and interest rate features.
- Numerical features show different distributions between defaulters and non-defaulters.
- Correlation analysis highlights relationships among financial variables.

All EDA steps are available in:

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing stage prepares the data for modeling by ensuring consistency
and avoiding data leakage.

Steps performed:
- Separation of features and target variable
- Identification of numerical and categorical columns
- Handling missing values:
  - Median imputation for numerical features
  - Most-frequent imputation for categorical features
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Categorical encoding using `OneHotEncoder`
- Stratified train-test split to handle class imbalance

## 🤖 Models Trained
Two machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Used as a baseline model
   - Simple and interpretable

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Final selected model
   - Handles non-linear relationships effectively
   - Uses class weighting to address imbalance

Model training and evaluation:

## 🏆 Model Performance
The Random Forest model outperformed the baseline Logistic Regression model.

Key results:
- ROC-AUC: ~0.93
- Recall (Default class): ~71%
- Strong balance between precision and recall for defaulters

Because the dataset is imbalanced, metrics such as **ROC-AUC**, **recall**, and
**confusion matrix** were prioritized over accuracy.

## 💾 Model Artifact
The trained model file (`.pkl`) is **not included** in this repository due to
GitHub file size limitations.

The model can be generated by running the notebook:

This approach ensures full reproducibility of the results.
